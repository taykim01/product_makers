    +"\narises, neuroscientists have explored the brain activity that underlies our constant sense of"
    +"\nbeing oneself. Most studies suggest an important role for the right hemisphere (van Veluw"

    +"\nyour brain hemispheres just behind your eyes, seemingly helps stitch together your sense"
    +"\nof self. It becomes more active when you think about yourself (Farb et al., 2007; Heleven"
    +"\n& Van Overwalle, 2019; Zimmer, 2005). Despite the many ways we adapt our behavior,"
    +"\nmost people believe that they have a true self that is unchangeable (Christy et al., 2019)."
    +"\nThe elements of your self-concept, the specific beliefs by which you define yourself, are"
    +"\nyour self-schemas (Markus & Wurf, 1987). Schemas are mental templates by which we"
    +"\norganize our worlds. Our self-schemas — our perceiving ourselves as athletic, overweight,"
    +"\nsmart, or anything else — powerfully affect how we perceive, remember, and evaluate other"
    +"\npeople and ourselves. If being an athlete is one of your self-schemas, then you will tend to"
    +"\nnotice others’ bodies and skills, will quickly recall sports-related experiences, and will welcome"
    +"\ninformation that is consistent with your self-schema as an athlete (Kihlstrom & Cantor,"
    +"\n1984). Because birthdays are within self-schemas, if your friend’s birthday is close to yours,"
